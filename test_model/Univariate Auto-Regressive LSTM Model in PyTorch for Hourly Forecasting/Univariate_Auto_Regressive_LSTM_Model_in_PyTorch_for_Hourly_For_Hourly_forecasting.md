This approach uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network built in PyTorch to forecast hourly electricity demand. It transforms historical demand data into a time series of 24-hour sequences (lags) and uses these to predict the next hourâ€™s demand. After training on 80% of the data, the model forecasts hourly demand for the entire year of 2023 by auto-regressively feeding each predicted value back into the input sequence. The demand values are normalized before training and inverse-transformed after prediction for interpretability. The model captures temporal trends effectively, making it well-suited for time-series forecasting tasks like this.
