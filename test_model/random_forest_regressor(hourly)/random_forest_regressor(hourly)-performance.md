This approach uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict hourly electricity demand by transforming the time series data into a supervised learning problem. It constructs lag features for the past 24 hours and adds calendar/time-based features such as day of the week, month, hour of the day, and weekend indicators. The model is trained on historical hourly data and is then used to recursively forecast demand for every hour in 2023, using each new prediction as input for the next step.

🧠 Why It Works – Key Reasons (in points):
📊 Lag Features Capture Temporal Dependency:

Electricity demand often follows strong hourly patterns (e.g., peak in the evening).

By including the past 24 hours (Demand_Lag_1 to Demand_Lag_24) as input features, the model learns short-term temporal trends.

🗓️ Calendar Features Add Seasonality Context:

Features like HourOfDay, DayOfWeek, Month, and IsWeekend help capture daily and weekly demand cycles.

These allow the model to distinguish between, say, a Monday morning and a Sunday night.

🌲 Random Forest Handles Nonlinear Interactions Well:

Random Forest is robust to outliers, works well with tabular data, and models non-linear relationships efficiently.

It doesn't assume any specific structure in the data like linear regression or ARIMA.

🔁 Recursive Forecasting for Future Steps:

The model is used iteratively, where each prediction becomes the next hour’s lag.

This simulates real deployment where only past predicted values are available at inference time.

📉 Interpolation of Missing Data:

Using interpolate(method='time') ensures the time series continuity and reduces error due to missing or noisy values.

🧠 No Deep Learning Required:

Unlike LSTM-based models, this approach avoids heavy computation and complex tuning while still capturing meaningful patterns.
