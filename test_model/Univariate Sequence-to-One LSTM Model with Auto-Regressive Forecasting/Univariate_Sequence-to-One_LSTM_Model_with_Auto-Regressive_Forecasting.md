This approach employs a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to model and forecast hourly electricity demand. It transforms historical demand data into 24-hour sliding windows to capture temporal patterns and daily cycles. After training, it uses an auto-regressive strategy where each new prediction is appended to the input sequence to forecast the next hour, allowing the model to produce a full yearâ€™s worth of hourly predictions. The use of LSTM ensures the model captures time-based dependencies effectively, and normalization along with dropout helps improve generalization and stability.
