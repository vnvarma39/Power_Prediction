This model implements a Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) LSTM neural network to forecast electricity demand six hours ahead based on the previous 24 hours. The time series data is preprocessed by interpolating missing values and scaled using MinMax normalization. The model uses a 2-layer LSTM followed by a dropout layer and a dense layer to output 6 continuous hourly predictions simultaneously. It is trained on historical data with validation and test splits to monitor generalization. Once trained, it performs recursive multi-step forecasting for all of 2023 using a sliding window over the predicted values. The approach is efficient for handling correlated multi-step outputs and avoids error accumulation typical of recursive single-output LSTM models.

✅ Why the MIMO LSTM Model Works
📌 LSTM Strength in Time Series:
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks are designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them ideal for time series like electricity demand.

📊 Sequence-to-Multi-Step (MIMO) Learning:
Instead of predicting just the next time step, this model predicts the next 6 hours all at once, which:

reduces the number of predictions needed to forecast long horizons

captures interdependence between multiple future time steps (e.g., demand at t+1 affects t+2)

🔁 Reduces Error Accumulation:
In recursive models (1-step-ahead predictions looped), small errors compound over time.
MIMO avoids this by predicting multiple steps directly from clean input data.

🧠 Learns Temporal Patterns Automatically:
The LSTM layers automatically learn time-based features like daily patterns, trends, and demand spikes without manual feature engineering.

📉 Dropout Regularization:
Dropout helps prevent overfitting by randomly disabling neurons during training, improving generalization to unseen future data.

⚙️ Smooth Forecasting with Rolling Window:
The prediction loop uses a sliding window approach to update the sequence and roll forward in time effectively.

📐 Scaled Learning and Inverse Transformation:
Scaling the input (via MinMaxScaler) improves training efficiency, and inverse-transforming predictions ensures they're in the original unit (MW), making them interpretable.

🧪 Train/Val/Test Split with MSE Loss:
A proper data split ensures robust evaluation, and MSE (Mean Squared Error) loss is well-suited for continuous numerical prediction.

📉 Learning Curve Monitoring:
Tracking both training and validation loss over 70 epochs allows you to see convergence and adjust if overfitting/underfitting appears.

📈 Visual & Metric-Based Evaluation:
Plots and metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R² offer clear evidence of model performance on test data.
