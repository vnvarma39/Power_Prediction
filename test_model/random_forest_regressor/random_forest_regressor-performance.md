ðŸ“Œ Summary:
This approach uses a Random Forest Regressor to perform daily electricity demand forecasting by modeling temporal dependencies through lag features (previous 7 daysâ€™ demands) and calendar-based features like day of the week, month, week of year, and weekend indicator. The dataset is preprocessed from hourly to daily average demand, and feature engineering transforms it into a supervised learning format. After training the model on historical data, future demand for all days in 2023 is predicted recursively, where each new prediction becomes an input lag for the next day.

ðŸ§  Why it Works:
Random Forests are powerful ensemble models that handle non-linear relationships and interactions well. In time series, past demand values (lags) are strong predictors of future values, and including seasonal/cyclic patterns (like weekdays vs weekends, or monthly effects) boosts accuracy. By simulating a recursive forecasting loop, the model mimics real-world deployment, where only past predictions are available at inference time. Though it doesn't explicitly model time dependencies like LSTMs, the lagged features + decision trees allow Random Forest to approximate time dynamics effectively for short-term and medium-term forecasts.
