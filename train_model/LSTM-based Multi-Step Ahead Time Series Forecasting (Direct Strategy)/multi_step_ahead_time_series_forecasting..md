This approach uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the next 6 hourly electricity demand values based on the previous 24 hours of demand data. The model is trained in a multi-output regression setup where a single forward pass directly outputs all 6 future time steps at once (also called the direct multi-step forecasting strategy). The data is preprocessed by normalizing demand, converting it into sequences for past 24 hours, and then reshaped for LSTM input. The model is evaluated using RMSE and MAPE, and visualized by comparing predicted and actual values for multiple samples.

ü§î Why This Works:
LSTMs are designed to handle sequential data and capture temporal dependencies effectively ‚Äî making them well-suited for time series forecasting. By training the model to learn from hourly trends over a 24-hour window and directly predicting a sequence of future points (rather than one step at a time), the model avoids error accumulation seen in recursive approaches. This strategy helps maintain temporal coherence and provides more stable and accurate short-term forecasts, especially when the sequence structure (daily/weekly patterns) is consistent.

üîç How to Interpret It:
General Trend Matching:
In all samples, the model successfully captures the upward or downward trends of the demand ‚Äî even if the magnitude is slightly off. This is a sign that the LSTM has learned the temporal structure reasonably well.

Prediction Lag / Underestimation:
Some predictions (e.g., in Sample 2 and 3) are consistently below the actual values. This could be due to slight bias in training, limited capacity, or regularization effects.

Shape Alignment:
The predicted curve closely follows the curvature of the actual values, especially from hour 2 onwards ‚Äî indicating the model is not just guessing flat averages but learning patterns.

Error Growth with Horizon:
Generally, the further out in time (e.g., Hour 5), the larger the divergence ‚Äî which is expected in time series forecasting since uncertainty compounds with each step ahead.
