This approach uses a Many-to-One LSTM model to forecast electricity demand one step (hour) ahead based on the previous 24 hourly values. The raw time series data is first cleaned, interpolated, and normalized. A sliding window of 24 time steps (representing past 24 hours) is used to construct input sequences, where each sequence predicts the next hourâ€™s demand. These sequences are passed into an LSTM network with two hidden layers, followed by a linear layer to output a single predicted value. The model is trained using Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and evaluated using RMSE and MAPE.
